Ironhack Project 3

# Description
Web app available for doctors and individuals (patients).
It enables individuals to book doctor appointments online.
Then the patient can view his appointments (and delete the incoming ones) but also, once the appointment has occured, he will have access to the visit report and the prescriptions.
The prescriptions will also be available in a Medication Planner where all the medications, time and quantities will be viewable in a schedule.

On his side, the doctor can receive bookings, upload the visit report, and add the medications.
This app offers more visiliby to his business and make it easier for the individuals to view the doctors availabilities and book appointments 24/7.
